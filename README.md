The Robocharger is a 2x2 entity that offers a charging post for robots. Using a Roboport, Iron, Copper, and a couple Big electric poles, we're able to fashion a tesla coil on top of one of the poles. 

The Robocharger connects to other roboports if it is within their *logistics* area. It does not have a logistics area or construction area itself and can not hold robots or repair packs. However, it offers 10 charge ports for robots to use in passing.
